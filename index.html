			<td id="review">This was my favourite movie in the trilogy. The character writing was impressive and the plot twist at the end was unexpected. I also learned that to love the present one must first learn to understand one's past.</td>

			<td id="tr1">Po now realizes that he has a lot to learn. After reuniting with his long-lost father hr must transition from student to teacher and train a group of fun-loving, clumsy pandas to become martial-arts fighters. Together, the kung-fu brethren unite to take on the evil Kai who is a supernatural warrior who becomes stronger with each battle.

			<td id="characters">Jack Black (Po), Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Jackie Chan (Monkey), Lucy Liu (Viper), David Cross (Crane), Seth Rogen (Mantis), Bryan Cranston (Panda Dad), Kate Hudson (Mei Mei)</td>
			<td id="review">In my opinion, Kung fu Panda 3 was the least memorable. I wish it had more action and drama and I wish the villain had more depth. I had high expectations from this movie since it was the last of the trilogy. But, I do like the lessons about family that it taught me. However, the plot was bland and the movie lacked the action that I was used to in the previous movies. I did like the new places and the new characters that were introduced in Kung Fu Panda 3. These characters include Po's brothers, sisters, and his father.
